                        Each member will have an account which has a re-occurring membership fee and the fee will be
                        made upon initiation of membership and automatically withdrawn on the 1st of each month after
                        initiation. CANCELLATION Any member may cancel their membership at any time, ThaNetwork will not
                        give refunds when a membership is cancelled. All Members who cancel their account will lose all
                        membership benefits to include the loss of monthly payments for referred members. Only Paid
                        Members will earn payments for referrals made. Once the membership is cancelled, the member’s
                        profile will be deleted.
                        Each member who uses the site and builds their personal network will receive payment for signing
                        up each member on a monthly basis, for as long as that member continues their membership. Your
                        membership payment will be withdrawn on the 1st of every month and your monthly earnings will be
                        available to you on the 15th of each month. Payments for new members joining your network will
                        be sent to each member after payments are processed and available for transfer. If your
                        recurring payment is rejected for any reason, we will send you notifications via email, text,
                        and internal message from the site. If you have not paid your membership dues by the 7th of the
                        month, your membership will be placed in a hold status until the 14th of the month. If payment
                        is not received by the 14th your account will be closed, all network payments to you will
                        discontinue, and the member will lose all network connections within the member’s personal
                        network. The only way you can become a member to the network again is if a member invites you
                        back or if you receive an invitation code from the company, either way you will have to start
                        from scratch to rebuild your network. The community is created for members to be able to help
                        each other meet their membership goals. Each member is responsible for inviting members to the
                        site if they desire to earn payment. If you do not invite any members, you will not earn
                        payment. ThaNetwork.org is not responsible for paying any member payment for just joining the
                        site. Referral Payment is earned by getting others to join the site, if you do not refer anyone
                        you will not receive Referral Compensation. Each member may invite as many people as you like to
                        join your network. This is not a multilevel marketing site; each member earns cash for making
                        referrals and getting those referrals to join the member’s network. ThaNetwork has a simple
                        philosophy, GET AS MANY PEOPLE to join your network to reap the benefits of fulfilling your
                        earning goals. As the membership demand for the network grows, the cost to become a member and
                        the member’s earnings will increase. Membership fee increases will only apply to new member’s
                        joining the site. Each member’s original membership fee will never change for the life of the
                        member’s membership. (Example) member joins and membership fee is $29.99 per month. Six months
                        later the membership fee increases to $59.99. The membership fee increase will only apply to new
                        members who join ThaNetwork. As membership fees increase each member who invites new members at
                        the increased membership fee will earn more income for each member who joins the member’s
                        network at the new rate. List of forecasted membership fee increases along with member earnings

                        effect. In the event there is a discrepancy between this English language version and any

                        terms of this Agreement and the language contained within the side summaries the full version of
                        the Agreement shall prevail.

                    <p>As a member of ThaNetwork each member's payment method will incur a monthly membership fee of

                        agree with the terms, acknowledge this agreement by selecting the box below.     (I agree and

                    <p>When a member joins ThaNetwork, a payment receipt will be sent to the member's personal email
                        address each time a payment is deducted from the member's payment method, and when payments are

                    <p>Membership payments will be made deducted on the 1st of each month.  When new member's join they

                    <p>When a new member joins ThaNetwork, the referring member will not receive payment until the
                        payment has been processed.  Once the payment is processed the funds will be credited to the
                        member's account and the member will receive an email and notification of receiving payment with
                        the new member's name and username included in the message.</p>
                    <p>If a member cancels their membership they will not receive a refund, and if the member has
